Linked List Project
This project was implemented with a collection with a parameterized type. It also includes some linked list methods, which includes:
A getSize() method that serves as the getter for the size variable.
A addToEnd method that adds the element to the tail of the list.
A addToFront method that adds the element to the head of the list.
A getFirst method that returns the head element.
A getLast that returns the tail element.
A retrieveFirstElement method that removes and returns the head element.
A retrieveLastElement method that removes and returns the tail element.
A removeAllInstances method that removes all instances of the target element from the list. 
A iterator that returns an instance of an anonymous inner class that defines an Iterator over this list (from head to tail).
